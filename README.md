World Happiness Report Analysis (2015–2019)

Objective

This project analyzes the World Happiness Report rankings between 2015 to 2019, with a special focus on India’s performance compared to top-ranked countries.

Data Preparation

We imported the data sheets from 2015 to 2019 into Power BI. Using Power Query, we cleaned and transformed the data: Made all the column headers the same across every sheet. Added the missing Dystopia Residual column for 2018 and 2019. Added a Year column to each sheet so we can identify which data belongs to which year once appended. Removed unnecessary columns that were not useful for our analysis. Finally, we combined (appended) all the sheets into a single sheet containing data from all years.

The study highlights:

India’s ranking dropped significantly from 117 (2015) to 140 (2019). The decline is linked to a consistent decrease in factors contributing to the Happiness Score. In contrast, the top-ranked countries maintained stable scores due to steady contributing factors.

Key Insights

India’s Decline: India’s ranking dropped because important factors like income, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and trust in government went down over the years. Top Countries’ Stability: Countries like Finland, Denmark, and Norway stayed at the top because these factors remained steady or improved slightly. Comparison: Looking at India alongside the top countries shows how strong social, economic, and cultural stability helps maintain higher happiness levels.
